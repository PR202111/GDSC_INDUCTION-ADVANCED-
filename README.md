## Task Completed

### Transformer Architecture – GPT-2 Control Flow

- Read and analyzed the **Transformer research paper**.
- Studied the architecture of **GPT-2 (decoder-only transformer)**.
- Created a **hand-drawn control flow diagram** showing how tokens are processed through:
  - Embeddings
  - Multi-Head Self-Attention
  - Feed-Forward Networks
  - Residual connections and Layer Normalization
- Implemented the following as **independent functional modules**:
  - Multi-Head Attention
  - Positional Encoding ( but as a nn.Embedding :) )
